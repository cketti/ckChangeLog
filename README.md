This library provides an easy way to display a change log in your app.

## Features

 * Displays changes since the last app update
 * Can display the complete change log history
 * Uses a simple XML file as source
 * Supports partial translations

## Usage

1. Create the master change log in `res/xml/changelog_master.xml`. Formatted like this:

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <changelog>
      <release version="1.1" versioncode="11" >
          <change>Totally new and shiny version</change>
      </release>
      <release version="1.0" versioncode="10" >
          <change>Fixed: A bug fix</change>
          <change>Some other changes I can't quite remember</change>
      </release>
      <release version="0.1" versioncode="1">
          <change>First release</change>
      </release>
  </changelog>
  ```

2. Create translations of this `changelog_master.xml` file in files named `changelog.xml` under
language-specific versions of `res/xml/`, e.g. `res/xml-de/changelog.xml`.

3. Display the change log dialog by putting the following code in your activity's `onCreate()` method:

  ```java
  ChangeLog cl = new ChangeLog(this);
  if (cl.isFirstRun()) {
      cl.getLogDialog().show();
  }
  ```

## Include the library

The easiest way to add ckChangeLog to your project is via Gradle. Just add the following lines to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'de.cketti.library.changelog:ckchangelog:1.2.0'
}
```

To tell Gradle where to find the library, make sure `build.gradle` also contains this:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
